# Los Angeles Crime Data Analysis Project

This project provides an in-depth analysis of crime data in Los Angeles, California, using a dataset from the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD). The goal is to identify patterns in crime occurrences to aid the LAPD in resource allocation and strategy planning for crime prevention.

## Project Overview

Los Angeles, known for its entertainment industry and sprawling coastline, also faces challenges with crime due to its large population. In this project, crime data from various LA areas is analyzed to uncover insights about crime timing, locations, and victim demographics. By understanding these patterns, the LAPD can allocate resources more effectively to enhance public safety.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is a modified version of the publicly available data from Los Angeles Open Data. Key columns include:

- `DR_NO`: Official file number of the report
- `Date Rptd`: Date when the crime was reported
- `DATE OCC`: Date of crime occurrence
- `TIME OCC`: Time (24-hour format) of crime occurrence
- `AREA NAME`: The area or patrol division responsible for the location
- `Crm Cd Desc`: Crime description
- `Vict Age`: Victim's age
- `Vict Sex`: Victim's gender
- `Vict Descent`: Victim's ethnic descent
- `Weapon Desc`: Weapon description (if applicable)
- `Status Desc`: Status of the investigation
- `LOCATION`: Address or specific location of the crime

## Key Findings

- **Peak Crime Hour**: Crimes in Los Angeles are most frequent around **12 PM**, indicating that midday is a high-risk period.
- **Night Crime Hotspot**: The **Central area** records the highest number of crimes during nighttime hours (10 PM to 3:59 AM), suggesting a need for increased police presence in this area during late hours.
- **Victim Age Group**: The **26-34 age group** experiences the highest crime frequency, with over **47,000 incidents**, followed by the **35-44 age group** with around **42,000 incidents**.

These insights can assist the LAPD in more strategically deploying resources based on crime timing, location, and victim demographics.


## Future Work

Further analysis could explore:

- Seasonal trends in crime rates across LA neighborhoods.
- Patterns in weapon use and its impact on crime severity.
- Comparative analysis across different LAPD divisions to identify crime prevention best practices.
